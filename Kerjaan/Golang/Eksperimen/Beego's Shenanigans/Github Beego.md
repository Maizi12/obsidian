Title: Lack of documentation for intercepting responses with global middleware in Beego v2 (AfterExec & returnOnOutput)

Type: üõ†Ô∏è Optimization Request
Beego Version: v2.3.7

### Description
I was attempting to create a global middleware to intercept and log the response after it has been written, by using beego.InsertFilter with AfterExec. However, I noticed that neither AfterExec nor FinishRouter filters were triggering my middleware as expected when the response was already sent.

After tracing the call stack using a debug helper:

```go
beego.InsertFilter("/*", beego.BeforeExec, middleware.ResponseInterceptor)

func ResponseInterceptor(ctx *context.Context) {
	for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
		pc, _, _, ok := runtime.Caller(i)
		if ok {
			fn := runtime.FuncForPC(pc)
			_, line := fn.FileLine(pc)
			fmt.Println(fn.Name() + " Line " + strconv.Itoa(line))
		}
	}
}
```

I found that the chain stops inside the FilterRouter.filter() function due to this early return:
```go
if f.returnOnOutput && ctx.ResponseWriter.Started {
	return true, true
}
```
### Workaround
By inspecting InsertFilter, I realized that this returnOnOutput flag is set to true by default. So I manually disabled it:
```go
beego.InsertFilter("/*", beego.AfterExec, middleware.LogInterceptor, beego.WithReturnOnOutput(false))
```

This change allows my `AfterExec` middleware to run even after a response has already started.

### Concern

While this works, it was **non-obvious** and **undocumented**. There‚Äôs no clear mention in the official Beego docs that:

- `returnOnOutput` must be set to `false` to execute filters after the response is started.
    
- `AfterExec` can be used for post-response logging with the correct configuration.

### Recommendation

1. Please **add documentation or examples** showing how to intercept response after it's written.
    
2. Consider **exposing a dedicated helper** or config flag (e.g., `InsertPostResponseFilter(...)`) to simplify this setup.
    
3. If possible, update the behavior so `AfterExec` runs by default even if response is started ‚Äî or document the current design tradeoffs clearly.
