## 🧠 Mindset Tips:

- **Your time isn't lacking. It's just leaking.** Patching leaks (scrolling, disorganized tools) will buy back hours.
    
- **Don’t aim for perfection** — aim for 70% consistency.
    
- **Build momentum, not motivation.** You already do hard things (Fajr, classes, working). You’re capable.
